### Atlanta-Crime-App
R Shiny App that looks at crime in different Atlanta Neighborhoods.

####  IMPORTANT STUFF
There are over 200 neighborhoods in Atlanta. In order to get all the Long./Lat. data, I created a loop to pull it all from Google Maps.
I had an API Key, but for some reason I could only pull around 50 neighborhoods worth of Long./Lat. data. After I downloaded the Neighborhood Map data into the environment, I saved it into a folder, and would import the Neighborhood map data everytime I ran the App.

#### YOU ONLY NEED TO RUN LINES 42-67 ONCE, THEN JUST RUN LINES 73-75.
